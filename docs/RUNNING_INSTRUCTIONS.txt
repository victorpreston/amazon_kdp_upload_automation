3. RUNNING THE SYSTEM
--------------------
There are two ways to run the system:

A. FULL PROCESS (Recommended):
- Double-click 'run_kdp_full_process.bat'
- This will:
  1. Run KDP_Preparation.exe to organize your book files
  2. Then run KDP_Automation.exe to upload them to KDP

B. MANUAL PROCESS:
1. Preparation Phase:
   - Run 'KDP_Preparation.exe'
   - This organizes your books into the 'prepared_books' folder
   - Check the output and logs if needed

2. Upload Phase:
   - Run 'KDP_Automation.exe'
   - This will upload the prepared books to KDP

4. SCHEDULED OPERATION
---------------------
The system is designed to:
- Automatically process 3 books per day at 9:00 AM
- You can modify this schedule by editing:
  - In kdp_preparation.py: schedule.every().day.at("09:00")
  - In kdp_automation.py: The scheduling configuration

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------
Common Issues:
- Chrome driver mismatch: Update Chrome browser
- Login failures: Check credentials in config.ini
- File not found: Verify metadata_full.csv exists

Log Files:
- Check the 'logs' folder for detailed error information

  - kdp_preparation_YYYYMMDD.log
  - kdp_automation_YYYYMMDD.log

6. IMPORTANT NOTES
